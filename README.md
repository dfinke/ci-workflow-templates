This is a repository for workflow templates to run Pulumi in CI/CD systems.

These templates are used by the Pulumi Console to provide customized templates based on your stack.

## Template Tokens

The following tokens are supported by the Console so that they are dynamically replaced:

* `PulumiStackName`
* `PathFilter`
* `WorkingDirectory`
